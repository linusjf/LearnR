# Comment: Code by Steve Miller (Graduate student in the Statistics Department,
# The University of Auckland).  An example of a one-off image using the
# traditional graphics system.  All parameters are hard-coded and the image only
# looks right when drawn with a specific aspect ratio (4:1).  Also an example of
# drawing an empty plot with a specific coordinate system and then building up a
# final image by drawing individual lines and and pieces of text.  Small point of
# interest is the use of some special glyphs (e.g., treble clef) from the Hershey
# vector fonts.
