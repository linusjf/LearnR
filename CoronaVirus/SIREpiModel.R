# infection rate since Corona Virus is unknown set to 1 average recovery time for
# Corona Virus is 7 days epimodel suggests that it is the inverse of average
# recovery time world population birth and death rates are picked from Wikipedia
# death rate for Corona Virus is 3.5% on high side using R0 of 3.5 and incubation
# duration of 2-14 days, recovery ranges from 2 days to a month a rough estimate
# of contact or activity rate per per person per day can be estimated since no
# person has immunity to Corona Virus, the probability of infection will be close
# to 1. Alternatively, use the probability of infection from a common cold if
# that data is available.  This can be reduced by self-isolation and sanitary
# habits. Using 0.8 as value.  activity rate * prob of infection = beta you could
# run stochastic version of the model as well on a machine with enough memory The
# activity rate can be estimated by using R0/average duration of disease
